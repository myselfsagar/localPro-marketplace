## üåü Project Overview

This is the capstone project for the Sharpener Full Stack Web Development course. The goal was to build a complete, real-world, product-focused application from scratch.

Built with a focus on user experience and real-world application, mimicking features found in popular service marketplaces.

      ```ini
      PORT=4000 # Or your desired local port

      # Database Credentials
      DB_HOST=localhost
      DB_USER=your_mysql_username
